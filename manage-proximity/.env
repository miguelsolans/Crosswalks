# Academic Project: Proximity Manager
# Micro-Service: Proximity Manager
# Authors: Miguel Solans, César Borges, Fábio Senra
# Notes: Proximity Manager, unlike the rest of 
#	 microservices, implements a WebSocket
#	 bi-directional communication, in order to
#        track Pedestrians and Cars movements, so 
#	 notification can be emitted, whether it is
#        safe to cross the road or not.
